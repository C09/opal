OPAL
====

Opal is not a Patient Activity List

We'd love you to get involved by using what we make, reporting bugs/suggesting improvements, and fixing bugs/making improvements. 

Opal is an open (open governance + open source) commercial NHS IT product by Open Health Care UK

What problem does Opal solve?
======
Opal aims to solve the patient list problem (with video explanation crowd-sourced from rival solutions...)

The patient list problem is this: Doctors need ready access to core information needed to look after their patients such as who their patients are and where they are, what's wrong with them, what the plan is, and what progress has been made against the plan.... The widespread, but suboptimal, solution to this problem is to use a table in a Microsoft Word Document.

Open governance 
======
Access: availability of the latest source code, developer
support mechanisms, public roadmap, and transparency of
decision-making

Development: the ability of developers to influence the content
and direction of the project

Derivatives: the ability for developers to create and distribute
derivatives of the source code in the form of spin-off projects,
handsets or applications.

Community: a community structure that does not discriminate
between developers

Opal is developed in the open, and as such we welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, documentation, and code.

Unclear documentation, unexpected error messages definitely count as bugs - feel free to raise issues about them.

Please use the GitHub issue tracker to discuss contributions.

Issues in the github issue tracker labelled 'easy' have been identified as particularly appropriate for new contributors.

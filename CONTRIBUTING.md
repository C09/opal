Opal is being developeed in the open, and as such we welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, documentation, and code.  Please use the github issue tracker to discuss contributions.

However, please not that since the project is in its earliest stages, all code is likely to change rapidly as we move on from the first prototypes.

Once the codebase has stabilised, we will identify issues in the github issue tracker that would be particularly appropriate for new contributors.

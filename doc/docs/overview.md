# OPAL from 30K feet

OPAL is designed to make writing transactional digital services for a clnical environment easy.

It builds on established Open Source technologies with a track record of helping developers
build easy to maintain, robust applications.

Most notably, it makes use of [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) 
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

From there, OPAL provides you with a common batteries-included architecture for writing healthcare
applications, and a composable modular framework that takes advantage of generic, re-usable components.

OPAL is an entirely Open ([Source](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) & 
[Governance](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal)issues) product, as are the wide library of plugins.

OPAL was created by [Open Health Care UK](http://openhealthcare.org.uk), because it makes Healthcare IT Less Bad.

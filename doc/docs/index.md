## OPAL Documentation

OPAL is a framework that makes writing clinical digital services easy.

<img src="/img/clinical.advice.png" width="600px;" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

It builds upon [Django](https://djangoproject.com/), [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) 
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to help developers quickly build easy to maintain,
robust clinical applications.

This is the developer documentation.

OPAL is an entirely Open [Source](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal), 
Open [Governance](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues) product, as are the wide library of plugins.

### First Steps

If you're new to OPAL, then you'll want to take a look at the
[Installation instructions](installation.md), and then maybe take the 
[tutorial](tutorial.md).

### Full documentation

While [Topic guides](guides/topic-guides.md) are available for many key areas of OPAL,
the [Detailed reference material](reference/reference_guides.md) is a work in progress.

If you find any issues or missing areas of this documentation, please do raise it with the
team on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues).

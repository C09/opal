# Teams 

Episodes of care are assigned to n teams - broadly a tab in the list view.

Teams have one level of nesting.

Teams may be inactive, in which case they are not displayed.

Teams may be restricted in which they only appear for a subset of users.

The logic for showing restricted teams is implemented via plugins.

Teams are assigned to episodes via a `Tagging`

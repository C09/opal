# Static Files in OPAL

As with any Javascript heavy application, OPAL apps can quickly accumulate large numbers
of static files. OPAL ships with the [Django Compressor](http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
library out of the box, and uses it to manage the Javascript asset pipeline.

Do consult the excellent Django Compresor documentation for more details on exactly how this process works.

OPAL features a rich, self documenting set of open JSON APIs.

OPAL applications are generally simply a collection of Browser-based clients
for these APIs.

OPAL uses Django Rest Framework to provide it's APIs.

You may examine the API of any running OPAL application by navigating to the url `/api/v0.1/`
